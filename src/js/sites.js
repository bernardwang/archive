  detail: "I started this redesign with the goal to show off my technical skills and build the first iteration of my portfolio site. That semester at school I really enjoyed working in React, so I took the opportunity to learn something similar, Vue.js. I used the vue-loader starter which included Webpack, Pug, Tachyons, autoprefixer and a bunch of other dev goodies I had never used before. While designing the site, I relied heavily on a responsive grid system and bright colorful highlight colors.",

  detail: "The initial version of this site was built at the 2015 Boilermake hackathon at Purdue University. The hackathon had issues with the internet from the very beginning, so rather than work on a real hackathon project I started messing with some D3.js examples, eventually creating a starry sky visual that I adapted into a simple website. Aside from the fact that D3 was entirely unnecessary for this visualization and that the site was not at all performant, I had a lot of fun playing with the dynamically generated star effect.",

  detail: "I'm not sure exactly how I got the idea for this site, but it was both impractical and unnecessary. I wanted the text to be entirely print, so I went through the trouble of printing text on a notebook, taking pictures of the notebook, and then using those images AS my site. lol. Of course, I knew it would be impossible to update the text without retaking images, and it would be much much easier to just code a few lines of HTML, but this idea was far more novel and fun. I was just getting interested into web development but it seemed I didn't want to write a website with code.",
