  detail: "I started this redesign with the goal to show my technical skills and build the first iteration of my portfolio site. At the time I started building this, I was really enjoying working in React so I took the opportunity to learn something similar, Vue.js. I used the vue-loader starter which included Webpack, Pug, Tachyons, autoprefixer and a bunch of other dev goodies I had never used before. While designing the site, I relied heavily on a responsive grid system and bright colorful highlight colors.",

  detail: "The initial version of this site was built at the 2015 Boilermake hackathon at Purdue University. The hackathon had issues with the internet from the start of the event, so rather than work on a real hackathon project I messed with some D3.js examples eventually creating a starry sky visual that I adapted into a simple website. Aside from the fact that D3 is unnecessary for this kind of visualization and that the site was not at all performant, I had a lot of fun playing with the dynamically generated star effect.",

  detail: "I'm not sure how I came up with the idea behind this site, but it was definitely impractical and a bit silly. I wanted the text to be entirely print, so I went through the trouble of printing text on a notebook, taking pictures, and then using those images as my site. Of course, I knew it would be impossible to update the text and it would be much easier to just write HTML like normal people, but this idea was far more novel and fun (pun intended).",
